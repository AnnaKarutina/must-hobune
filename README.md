and, if necessary, talk to a mental health specialist.</p>

<hr />

## The problem

200,000 Estonians are without mental health care. Self-help workbooks available at [https://peaasi.ee](https://peaasi.ee/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Minuarevus_arevusbuklet_veeb_EE.pdf) today
are not engaging enough. User needs an application that listens to all his worries.

## This solution

You can assess your emotional state
and, if necessary, talk to a mental health specialist.

User can
- evaluate his current emotional state.
- think about his emotions and their sources, which have already arisen during the day.
- get a summary of his assessment and direct him to active activities to confirm and/or support it.
- contact mental health support specialists if necessary

## React Native

`<TouchableOpacity>` and others inside of your render method to generate awesome
autocomplete, dropdown, or selection components.

## Examples



## Inspiration

We were heavily inspired by [Youper: Mental Health Care For All](https://www.youper.ai/). 

We also took a few ideas from the
[Pixels - Mood & Mental Health](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ar.teovogel.yip&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1).

## Other Solutions

You can implement these other solutions using `minu päev`, but if you'd prefer
to use these out of the box solutions, then that's fine too:
